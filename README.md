# Small Office Network Design and Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a small office network with multiple LANs using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is segmented into different subnets and connected using a router to enable inter-LAN communication.

## Network Topology
- Three LANs representing different departments
- Each LAN connected via a switch
- A router configured to enable communication between network segments

## IP Addressing Scheme
- LAN 1 (HR)   : 192.168.23.0/26
- LAN 2 (IT)   : 192.168.23.64/26
- LAN 3 (SALES): 192.168.23.128/26


## Configuration Details
- Dynamic IP addressing configured on end devices
- Router interfaces configured with appropriate IP addresses
- Basic routing enabled for inter-LAN connectivity

## Verification
- End-to-end connectivity verified using ICMP (ping) tests between devices in different LANs

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Outcome
- Successfully designed and validated a multi-LAN small office network, gaining hands-on experience in subnetting, routing and network troubleshooting.
